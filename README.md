Logistic Regression Machine Learning Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a patient having cancer based on various diagnostic features.

Features
Logistic Regression Model: Applied to classify data into two classes (e.g., cancerous or non-cancerous).
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature selection, and scaling.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
Dataset Name: Cancer Logistic Regression.csv
Description: The dataset contains information on various diagnostic features of cancer patients. It includes columns for features such as tumor size, age, and other clinical parameters. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the patient has cancer (1) or not (0). This dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks in machine learning and provides a basis for evaluating the performance of classification algorithms like Logistic Regression.
Format: CSV
